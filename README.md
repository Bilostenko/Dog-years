# Dog-years
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age.

How old would you be if you were a dog?

1. Change a variable named myAge, and set it equal to your age as a number.
2. Change a variable named myName, and set it equal to your name as a string.
